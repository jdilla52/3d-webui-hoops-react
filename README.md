# example of binding a hoops scene to react

This is a CRA and has a some ideas for wrapping hoops in react. Hoops is a high performance wasm scene, however it can be odd to use, this is especially true if you're not using vanilla js. In terms of react a more holistic set of bindings is necessary. The hope is to play with some ideas here.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
